## Introduction
As a Redfish technical consultant I am very often asked where to start to learn Redfish. Depending on the context and the profile of the requester, I answer differently. Sometimes, it is sufficient to point to the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) web site, where the standard is published and sometimes it is not because there are hidden questions like:  "Can I do this or that with Redfish ?" or TBD

This article tries to answer this question with a  "tell me who you are and I'll tell you where to start". 

## High level consultant

What you probably want is a brief introduction. In this case, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfish_(specification)) is a good starting point with numerous references.  


## If you are a System or Network manager

You probably want to ramp-up on Redfish to start writing scripts to automate the management of your servers. 
The above Wikipedia article can be interesting for you but not enough. You probably want to better understand what features, properties and resources you can (and cannot) manage in your HPE servers. The [iLO RESTful API Ecosystem](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers/restful-api.html) page provides a lot of technical pointers TBD. Among them, you will find and TBD  blogs.

A good place to go, as well, is the [HPE DEV Slack #redfish channel](https://hpedev.slack.com/archives/C9RRCL9TJ). You will able to browse questions and answers from the System and Network Managers. Don't hesitate to ask as well or post comments.        


## If you are a developer 
Working on an important Redfish client project, I would recommand first the above locations (Wikipedia, the HPE iLO RESTful API ecosystem page). Then, go to DMTF specs and HPE Reference API documnent. Need to read as well the 

You can get inspired by the public iLOrest python tool and examples published in the HPE Redfish library GitHub. 

## Conclusion

TBD
